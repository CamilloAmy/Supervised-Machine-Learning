# Introduction To Supervised Madchine Learning

This repo includes all the example codes and data set used in my book 'Introduction to Supervised Machine Learning'. 
The purpose of this book is to document my teachings at Chiang Mai University in a physical form and make it accessible for students with limited resources to learn from. The book aims to provide a comprehensive and easy-to-follow introduction to the fundamental concepts of machine learning methods. It is divided into four parts.

The first chapter provides an overview of the basic questions of machine learning and introduces the Python development environment. The second chapter covers various regressionmethods and the third chapter discusses different classification methods. The last chapter provides recommendations for continuing the journey of learning machine learning.

I believe that hands-on learning is crucial for understanding and thus, the explanations in the book are accompanied by detailed ’Python code’ snippets throughout the text. The readers can follow the structions and run the code in this Repo on their own computer or an online platform such as Google Colab.
